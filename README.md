A program to determine platinum values of relic rewards in Warframe  

The following screenshot shows an example of people who would've benefitted from the app :)

## Usage
- Make sure Warframe is running in Borderless Fullscreen Mode
- Make sure your Desktop resolution is set to 1920x1080
- Run the program
- Press Numpad 0 to shrink the program
- Complete the mission and wait for the Relic Reward screen to appear
- Press Numpad 0 to maximize the program
- Click the button on the left or the right depending on how many players are running
- Optional: Click the "Copy & Shrink" button to copy the results to your clipboard to paste ingame (Will not work if an OCR fails)
- Enjoy!

## Known Bugs
- Will not work on screen sizes outside of 1920x1080
- Will not work solo, or with 2 players in the squad (Only 3 or 4)
- Occasional OCR Failure
- Weird UI Size (Will be fixed when Visual Studio 16.5 is released with the .NET Core WinForm UI Editor)

## Disclaimer
- As this program uses OCR and does not interact with Warframe directly (No Network Hooks / No DirectX Hooks / No automated input) it is considered fine to use  
- That said, this project is still in early development - Use at your own risk!
